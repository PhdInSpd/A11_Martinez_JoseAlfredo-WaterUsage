I uploaded the project after the assignment was due.
I build public project https://github.com/PhdInSpd/A11_Martinez_JoseAlfredo-WaterUsage.git
from directory
    ./target/classes/
I type @ the command line
    java edu.srjc.martinez.jose.a11_martinez_jose.WaterUsageApplication

I get response
   Error: Could not find or load main class edu.srjc.martinez.jose.a11_martinez_jose.WaterUsageApplication
   Caused by: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javafx/application/Application
